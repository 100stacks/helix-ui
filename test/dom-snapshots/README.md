# dom-snapshots

This is where auto-generated typescript files are placed as a means of generating our regression test suite. These typescript tests each navigate to a specific page in the docs site, find some helix-ui component that's been rendered in the browser, and uses a popular concept known as snapshot testing to either generate a baseline result for this test, or compare the current test run against what has been saved in the project previously.

We split the tests up because that's what Ava, our testing tool, wanted us to do. It was easier to write a hack where a single javascript file spits out pre-canned typescript test files into a dedicated dom-snapshots directory than it was to attempt to overcome the parallel test runner's opinions about being as context-free as possible.

In summary, these auto-generated typescript test files are ignored by version control. They are generated by the parent test runner script at runtime. These tests will look for elements in the dom that are flagged for regression testing, and will check to ensure that none of those elements have had their dom changed. If these changes have occurred, you need to make those changes part of your pull request. Otherwise, the pull request job will not pass. See https://github.com/HelixDesignSystem/helix-ui/wiki/Testing#how-do-i-update-a-snapshot for more details on how to do this.
